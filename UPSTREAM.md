# Upstream Notes

## Source

- upstream repo: `https://github.com/qiyanghong2020/de-ai-writing.git`
- local active skill path: `/home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing`
- current branch: `main`

## Local organization

This local skill now uses a single `main` branch:

- `origin/main` tracks the upstream repository
- local `main` is the active integrated version
- local enhancements are committed on top of upstream instead of being kept on a separate branch

## Local additions kept on top of upstream

- general `de-ai-writing` entry point for both Chinese and English
- language-lane routing through `references/chinese.md` and `references/english.md`
- stronger academic / thesis / medical guidance
- explicit checks for transition-word overload such as `此外` / `然而` / `总之`
- explicit checks for overly uniform grammar and sentence landing
- English AI-tone guidance for lexical overrepresentation, stock transitions, predictable rhythm, generic claims, and voice flattening
- extra quick references for phrase-level rewrites and risk words
- local reference file: `references/thesis-medical.md`
- long-document execution guidance in `references/execution-patterns.md`

## External reference consulted locally

- reference repo: `https://github.com/chi111i/BypassAIGC`

What was borrowed in spirit:

- segmented processing for long documents
- skipping very short or structural segments by default
- staged processing when the document is large or layout-sensitive
- compact history or style-memory summaries instead of carrying full context
- strict output contracts and terminology protection

What was deliberately not borrowed:

- verbosity expansion as an anti-AI tactic
- systematic addition of helper words such as `的` / `地` / `所` / `会`
- forcing longer sentences to simulate “humanity”
- prompt patterns that make Chinese more full, more explanatory, and more uniformly polished

## Practical sync workflow

To review upstream changes later:

```bash
git -C /home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing fetch origin
git -C /home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing diff --stat origin/main..main
git -C /home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing diff origin/main..main
```

To see only local edits on top of upstream:

```bash
git -C /home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing status --short
git -C /home/hongqy/.codex/skills/de-ai-writing log --oneline origin/main..main
```

## Reminder

The active skill is the local directory under `~/.codex/skills`, not the remote repository by itself.
